Hey there! 👋 You've just stumbled upon my latest JavaScript project, and I'm super excited to share it with you! 🎉 Imagine experiencing a modern website with an awesome cursor effect that'll blow your mind! 💫

So, what's it all about? 🤔 Well, I've created this fantastic functionality that brings a cool cursor circle and a delightful follower circle into play. 🖱️🔍 The cursor circle, represented by a div element with the class "cursor", gracefully glides along with your mouse movements. But wait, there's more! The magic really happens with the follower circle – another div element with the classes "cursor" and "cursor__follower". 🧙‍♂️🌟 This one's just like a trusty sidekick following your main cursor with a slight delay, and boy, does it look amazing! 😎

To see the magic in action, simply move your mouse around the webpage! 🌈 Thanks to the "mousemove" event listener that I've added to the HTML root element, the cursor and the follower circle stay in perfect sync with your every move. 🐾✨ And it's all thanks to the setPosition function, which works its charm using the "translate3d" CSS property, allowing the elements to gracefully dance across the screen in response to your mouse coordinates. 🕺💃

I've made sure to style the cursor and follower elements with some snazzy CSS, so everything comes together in a visually appealing way. 👌🎨 Trust me, it's an eye-catching experience you won't want to miss!

So go ahead, check out my creation, and let me know what you think! 😄 Feel free to share any feedback or ideas to make it even more awesome. Happy Coding! 🚀🌟
